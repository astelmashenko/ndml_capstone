    "\n",
    "In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.\n",

    "Loans are very popular in US. People take loans for education, property, car, etc. The difinition of loan is:<br/>\n",
    "A loan is money, property or other material goods that is given to another party in exchange for future repayment of the loan value amount along with interest or other finance charges \\[1\\].There is a risk that a lender may not receive given credit back, it's called 'Credit Risk' \\[2\\]. Lenders, of course, want to minimize credit risks, for that they calculate 'Credit Score' \\[3\\]. A credit score is a number representing the creditworthiness of a person, the likelihood that person will pay his or her debts. Credit score is composed from several components related to a person, one of major components is 'Credit History'. A credit history is a record of a borrower's responsible repayment of debts.<br/>\n",
    "Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. It's possible to use alternative data, including telco and transactional information, to predict their clients' repayment abilities, which can help people to get loans from trustworthy lenders.<br/>\n",
    "My interest in the project is to take part in a real world problem, to work with real world not-prepared/not-cleaned data, take part in a competition (this project is from kaggle platform)."

Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem."

The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms)."

    "In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project."
